/**
 * Recursion is a method 
 * where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 
 * This method is mostly used in form of a Recursion Function applied to functions. 
 * [Problem] Find the factorial value of the given number, X (1 <= x <= 20) and 
 * print as shown below: The given number is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 20. 
 * [Input] The first input line contains the number of test cases, T. 
 * Then, T number of input will be given. 
 * [Output] For each given test case, print the factorial value.
